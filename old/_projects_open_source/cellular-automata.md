## What are cellular automata?

> Cellular Automata are computational models that are typically represented by a grid with values (cells). A cell is a particular location on a grid with a value, like a cell on a spreadsheet you’d see in Microsoft Excel. Each cell in the grid evolves based on its neighbors and some rule. Elementary CAs are visualized by drawing a row of cells, then evolving that row according to a rule, and displaying the evolved row below its predecessor. All this being said, they’re easiest to understand by example:
