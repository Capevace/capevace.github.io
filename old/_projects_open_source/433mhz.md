A Node package to transmit data on a Raspberry Pi using a 433MHz sender.

Note: I made this for my cheap remote outlets, I don't know if this is actually useful with other devices lol.

## Installation

```sh
npm install 433MHz
```

## Usage

```js
const transmitCode = require("433MHz");

// Input the code that you want to be transmitted
transmitCode("1111111111111111111010111");

// You have multiple options to customize the transmission
transmitCode("1111111111111111111010111", {
  transmitPin: 18,
  shortDelay: 0.001,
  longDelay: 0.005,
  packetDelay: 0.05,
});
```

### Options

#### transmitPin

This is the pin, the data pin of the transmitter is connected to on the GPIO.
**Default:** 18

#### shortDelay

The short delay between pin output state changes.
**Default:** 0.00037

#### longDelay

The longer delay between pin output state changes.
**Default:** 0.00101

#### packetDelay

The delay between attempts (packets) of code data transmitted.
**Default:** 0.01102

## Intertechno switch code lookup

I personally made these for my old Intertechno radio outlets which use a 12-bit code system. Below is a table where you can build your code to send by going from left to right.

|     Group      |     Switch     | Constant Value | On / Off  |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :-------: |
| A: `1111 1111` | 1: `1111 1111` |   `1110 101`   | On: `01`  |
| B: `1011 1111` | 2: `1011 1111` |                | Off: `11` |
| C: `1110 1111` | 3: `1110 1111` |                |           |
| D: `1010 1111` |                |                |           |
