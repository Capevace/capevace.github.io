Learning a new technology without building a real-world application is hard. Building a Hacker News client teaches you some of its most important aspects. They provide a great API, that makes it easy to get started with a UI-related project. _Also I just wanted my own Hacker News client but this sounds way cooler_.

## Features

- Browse Hacker News posts (obviously, _duh_)
- Read & browse through comments
- Bookmark your favourite posts
- That's about it...

### Coming soon

- Cache bookmarked posts for offline-reading
- iCloud Sync for bookmarks
- I'll also try to implement some kind of way to post articles & comments to HN, but there's no official API for this so it might be a bit hacky...
