WordPress License Server enables you to supply automatic updates for the plugins you develop, while only allowing such features if the customer actually owns a license.

<br>

You can either create and manage your own licenses or simply verify Envato Purchase Codes using the Envato API.
The Laravel application / PHP script is built for other theme/plugin developers, who want automatic updates and license/Envato purchase code verification for their own plugins. So if you want to implement such features into your plugin, this project is right for you!

## Features

- Automatic updates for your premium plugins
- Verify Envato Purchase Codes
- Verify Licenses that youâ€™ve issued yourself
- Detects if the customer is still in support-time window
- Easy PHP integration into your WordPress plugins
- Clean, extendable PSR-4 PHP code
- Built using Laravel
- Easy-to-use admin backend
- Beautiful User Interface
