When trying to copy long paragraphs of text from my phone to my computer, I noticed that there is no easy way to just do that. [Clippo](https://clippo.mateffy.me) tries to solve that problem.

<br>

[Clippo](https://clippo.mateffy.me) is a small web service through which you can securely share your clipboard with many devices. Using a small authentication code, you can connect two devices and then exchange text or images by simply pasting it onto the site.

## Features

- Securely connect two devices by scanning a QR code or by entering a 6-character code
- Send text, images and videos
