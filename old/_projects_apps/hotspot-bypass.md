HotspotBypass offers an easy way to change your MAC address on macOS. Get unlimited access to data-capped WiFi by randomizing your address everytime you run out of data or impersonate other network users and take theirs.

## Features

- Change your MAC address
- See other MAC addresses in your current network
- Time your MAC address changes (e.g. change every 10 minutes)

#### Disclaimer

Bypassing WiFi restrictions might not be legal in every country. Remember to check your local laws before using.
